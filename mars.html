							<p>In the year 2035, the mars colony has grown to a population of 100000. Hundreds of shipments arrive each day from Earth to the space port launch pads. Because of the limited number of launch pads and the rocket safety inspections after each landing and before a launch, there is a limited number of slots available for shipments each day. Currently each space shipping company has to request a reservation for a time slot and specify their requirements to be approved by a technician. But because of the time delay for Earth-Mars communications (up to 23 minutes), double bookings have happened and last-minute schedule changes have become bothersome and is costing a lot of working hours.<br />
								<br />
							The system needs to keep track of the launch pads and their availability. There needs to be an inventory of all space rockets in or out of operation, their models, their suggested cool off times, ownership and if they are a heavy rocket (like the Falcon heavy and BFR) which have special requirements. It needs to keep track of the space shipping companies as well and monitor their shipments. The companies from Earth will specify a date period estimation when they want the rocket to be assigned a landing zone. The system will then check the availabilities and assign a confirmed time and date for that reservation. A priority could also be assigned to the shipment if it is considered critical or urgent. The reservation must include details such as the rocket model, the shipment, whether astronauts are on board.<br /><br /> The astronauts must be registered on the system with their name, Space ID, age, level of expertise and if they require special assistance. A supervisor must be able to access and edit system if need be and also hand in the shipments to the approved company representatives. Companies will be assigned authorization codes to see the Launchpadâ€™s availabilities so they can send in an accurate time period estimation in their requests. Supervisors will be able to access the system from mars with their username and password. Supervisors will also be in charge of giving the authorization codes to the companies and registration of new astronauts and companies.<br />
